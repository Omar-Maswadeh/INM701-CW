# Problem to be solved:
The main purpose of this project was to train a model that would detect if subject has a tumor or
not base on brain MRI scan. This Brain Scan tumor Classification is a machine learning project.

# Description:

A series of fine-grained scans that show the interior architecture of the brain, those are used
to detect tumor in brain MRI imaging. The brain's anatomy is shown visually in these pictures.
